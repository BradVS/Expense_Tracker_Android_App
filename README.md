# Expense Tracker Android App

This project was created as part of my Android App development class.
The purpose of the app is for the user to create and save expenses to a local SQLite database on their device. The expenses hold various values including a name, date, category, and money value. Users can then use this app to look through expenses, and filter based on various search parameters.

As of December 2022, I decided to improve this project to follow better coding practices, and to include features that I had learned about since completing the assignment in university.

Technologies: Java, XML, Android, SQLite, Gradle
