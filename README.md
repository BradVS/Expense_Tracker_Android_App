# Expense Tracker App

This project was created as part of my Android App development class.
The purpose of the app is for the user to create and save expenses to a local SQLite database on their device. The expenses hold various values including a name, date, category, and 
money value. Users can then use this app to look through expenses, and filter based on various search parameters.

Technologies: Java, XML, Android, SQLite
